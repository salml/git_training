### Basic Branching/Pull Request Exercise

1. Clone this repo
2. Make a few changes and commits on a new branch
3. File pull request and ask for review/merge
4. Sync remote changes onto local machine

### Basic Forking Exercise

1. Fork this repo
2. Set up remote references on local (i.e., `origin` is your fork, `upstream` is central repository)
3. Make a few changes and commits on a new branch
4. File pull request from fork to central repo and ask for review/merge
5. Sync changes onto local machine from central repo

### A few common, trickier git maneuvers
Note: please work on a branch that is not `master`  
Also note: even though it's fine to mess up this repo, still be careful using `force push`

1. Update a pull request based on reviewer's feedback (either real or imaginary)
2. Pull pre-existing branch from a central repository, make changes, and push to remote fork 
3. Squash two commits into a single commit and push changes to remote fork
4. Amend a commit that's already been pushed to remote fork
5. Remove a commit that's already been pushed to remote fork
